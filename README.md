# NexConvert 🚀

Hey there! Welcome to **NexConvert**. 

We built this because we believe downloading your favorite YouTube content should be as beautiful as it is fast. No more clunky, ad-filled converters. Just a clean, premium experience that lets you grab your videos or audio and get back to what you were doing.

## The Magic Under the Hood 
We kept things modern and efficient:
- **Core**: Python & Flask (The reliable engine).
- **Download Power**: `pytubefix` (Doing all the heavy lifting).
- **Aesthetics**: Vanilla CSS with custom gradients and glassmorphism.

## Want to try it out? 🚀

### What you'll need
Just make sure you have **Python 3.8 or higher** and **pip** installed on your machine.

### Let's get it running
1. **Grab the code**: Clone this repository or download the zip.
2. **Install the essentials**:
   ```bash
   pip install flask pytubefix
   ```
3. **Fire it up**:
   Enter the folder in your terminal and run:
   ```bash
   python app.py
   ```
4. **See it in action**:
   Head over to `http://127.0.0.1:5000` in your favorite browser.

## A Quick Tour of the Files 
- `app.py`: The brain of the operation. It handles the routes and the actual conversion logic.
- `static/`: This is where our design lives, including the CSS and our preview assets.
- `templates/`:
  - `main.html`: Your stunning entrance.
  - `index.html`: The clean, focused converter page.
  - `result.html`: Where the magic happens (and your download link lives).
  - `error.html`: Because sometimes things go wrong, we made sure the error page looks good too.

## Just a heads up 📝
